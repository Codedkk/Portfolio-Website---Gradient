# Gradient Portfolio Website
I designed, developed and deployed a fully responsive developer portfolio website utilizing React.Js, GSAP, React-scroll, and Sass.

Inserted some spontaneous design ideasüí°‚ú®,  played with some beautiful serene colors üåàüçß.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React.Js, GSAP, React-scroll, Sass

First of all, I sought guidance and examples of the content system of a developer's portfolio. It took some time to transform it into UI design. And the effort put into crafting a personal branding is very much worthwhile. This is the content aspect.

As for the process for the UI design, I liked the elegant look of the design system and wanted to infuse some ‚ú®personality‚ú® by using a more prominent font for the logo and incorporating splashes of colors.

During development, I started with the background. As the background spanned across components, I became aware of the interrelation between components.  So I first focused on laying out all the components and realizing their functionality. Then I dived into the details and styling.

The freedom to create something that represent myself for myself and inserting exciting new ideas I came across made this project very enjoyable amd memorable for me.

## Optimizations

 To fix flicker issue of useEffect.
 Animation could have more intricate effects -- some vision awaits.

## Lessons Learned:

Coomponent structure and state: the two main sections, hero section and the accordion, both required more complex management of state and component relation, which later proved can be tricky and should definately be planned before actual coding. From this experience, I learned some lessons on what could be planned to make the state and components more managable.

Finanlise design before next step, but I would also allow room for new ideas during the process, as it is easier to manage since this is an independent project.
